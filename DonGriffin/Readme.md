This folder is a Sencha Cmd 6 workspace. You will need Ext JS 6 Early Access to use
the application in the `apps\ticket` folder.

One way to do this is generate a dummy app:

    cd DonGriffin
    sencha --beta generate app Dummy dummy

This will download the pre-release of Ext JS 6 and install it into the workspace. You
can remove the dummy app once the `ext` folder exists.
